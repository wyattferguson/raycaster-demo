# :tv: Raycaster Python Demo

A simple demo of a 2D raycaster (think Wolfenstein 3D). By giving the caster only a 2d list it will render it into 3d, by casting rays out from the players POV and using that distance to calculate the hieght of each ractangle to draw.

This is just a simple proof of concept and would need a good refactor before being used in prime time.

## Controls

- W - Forward
- S - Backwards
- A - Rotate Left
- D - Rotate Right

## Installation & How To Use

Installation is pretty straight forward, Im using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage everything.

To get it all running from scratch:

```
# spin up a virtual enviroment
uv venv

# activate virtual enviroment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# install all the cool dependancies
uv sync

# use taskipy to simplify running everything
task run
```
