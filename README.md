# :tv: Raycaster Python Demo

A simple demo of a 2D raycaster (think Wolfenstein 3D). By giving the caster only a 2d list it will render it into 3d, by casting rays out from the players POV and using that distance to calculate the hieght of each ractangle to draw.

This is just a simple proof of concept and would need a good refactor before being used in prime time.
